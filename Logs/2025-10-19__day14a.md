just half a day really

I got the code to compile in Unreal again, and added the blinking police car lights just to make sure everything's working in principle. I also forked UnrealSharp so I'm not forced to updating the submodule every time they make a commit.

Importing assets in Unreal is a chore. I'll have to reimport again because out of nothing Unreal refreshed the mesh thumbnails and they were all black. And changes? Hah, good luck. It's all binary files. I should enable the "text asset format support" but according to google, it's experimental. Wow, how did they get this far?

Still, Unreal feels much closer to home than Godot.
