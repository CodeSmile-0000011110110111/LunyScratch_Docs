Actually just half a day really but it adds up with other recent semi-half days.

I wrote a second post on reddit. Won't check reactions until tomorrow. I know what to expect. :)

Right now, Junie is trying to port all my Unity code to Godot but it stopped after 8 minutes, telling me it's been working for a long time. It allowed me to continue the process, which I did, but ever since (for 12 minutes now) it just spins its "Working" icon. It probably got stuck. Fortunately, I can just stop and tell her to continue with the previous task.

I thought I'll give her a clean slate, commenting out all existing Godot scripts and even renaming them. But Junie is clever, it noticed what these files are, removed the comments, and started editing the code in place.
