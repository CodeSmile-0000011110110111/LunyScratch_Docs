Accurately computed LOC: Core=2368, Unity=989, Editor=148, total=3505. 

The codebase contains 83 core files, 25 unity files, and 2 editor files, with various counts of control flow statements and logical operators distributed across these files.

The codebase was analyzed for lines of code and complexity metrics split between Core and Unity+Editor areas. Core contains 67.6% of the code with slightly lower complexity per line and higher maintainability proxy than Unity+Editor. Both areas show high maintainability with Core being simpler per line of code.
