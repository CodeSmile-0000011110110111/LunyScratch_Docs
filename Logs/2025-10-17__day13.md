For the most part: see same date [GodotImplementationNotes.md](2025-10-17_GodotImplementationNotes.md)

The Godot port is functionally complete in less than 3 days.

Only minor things remain but they're not worth aligning or improving at this point. I'll rather move on to Unreal next.

Among those issues:

- when turning without moving forward/backward, the turn movement will begin to stutter if the car is standing still (seemingly: no interpolation for rotation only?)
- no day-night-cycle (trivial, and Godot is ugly as is anyway)
- balls don't 'explode' at the start as in Unity (physics engine difference)
- ball collisions happen more often than in Unity, adding more time more quickly (physics engine difference)
- subclassing of nodes doesn't scale, will need a different 'LifeCycleManager' approach for the actual port (and apply this lesson to Unity, since even there we want to be able to control scratch updates ie input/logic gating)
