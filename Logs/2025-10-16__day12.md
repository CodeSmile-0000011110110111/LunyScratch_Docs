It took me some convincing (half a dozen retries) to get Junie to do its job in Godot. 

I had to copy the Unity implementation into the project since she refused to read them from a directory outside the solution. The output was usable but required several updates and fixes. She also didn't finish many Godot-specific aspects, returning a constant value instead. 

She did however create the asset registry, and I merely had to allow addressing to work without the obnoxious "res://" prefix and assuming ".tscn" as the extension if none is given. For now that's fine.

The game has a working car controller, bumping into cubes spawns the gold cubes, and the progression and time are also working. The biggest challenge was with collision events. Mostly due to Godot not applying sensible defaults - above all things you have to manually enable collision event generation (aka "Contact Monitor") and after you do that, a new field appears "Max Contacts Reported" which is initially set to 0, therefore it MUST be changed to 1. Why on earth this would not default to zero, or even allow zero to begin with, I have no idea. 

I'm afraid there's plenty of such oddities throughout Godot, which aren't simply "me not being used to Godot", they are clearly UX failures. I started writing an EngineNotes.md to keep track of these things, and will do so for Unreal as well. I suppose for Unity I'm just too knowledgeable to judge it.

Needless to say, Godot's OOP design stinks like donkey's ass! It's like we went all the way back to the 90s when OOP was a huge hype, and overused and misapplied. Here, in my case, I had to ensure my police and Cube prefabs have the Rigidbody3D as their root, otherwise the body's parent object simply won't move away from its start location. And to enable that, I had to make a custom implementation of ScratchRigidbody3D on top of the already existing ScratchNode3D and ScratchNode2D, and it probably won't end there!

I will at least check if I can - somehow - inject a userdata, but it won't fix the necessity to subclass C# scripts from the Node class that it runs on. That is such a hugely obvious pain in the rear!

What bothers me the most is that Godot gets sold as the "easy engine" when it has so many non-obvious quirks and UX issues, requires much more work to get anything meaningful on the screen, hides many settings behind modal dialogs so you can't test those changes without closing and reopening the modal dialog (or even restarting the Editor), its Inspector is a nested mess where the most important feature - the Transform - gets pushed towards the bottom, and above all else: it teaches new students that "deeply nested OOP hierarchies are fine". It's not! Even Unreal (the original game) back in the mid-90s was based on an Actor/Component system, and component-driven game engine design quickly became the norm. I find it appalling that such a backwards design with well-known, severe usability and maintenance issues is now our entry-level game engine.

On a positive note, it's clear to me now that Godot will never find application in medium-large game production until they eventually, and almost certainly are going to, provide a Node/Component system and hopefully, eventually deprecate their OOP Node hierarchy even if it may be a lot of pain to redesign. Here's to hoping for the best!

Summary of things you have to do in Godot to get started with a 3D scene:

- create Scene3D
- add Camera, add AudioListener3D child
- add DirectionalLight3D
- add WorldEnvironment
- add Floor plane, add Rigidbody3D child, add CollisionShape3D grandchild
