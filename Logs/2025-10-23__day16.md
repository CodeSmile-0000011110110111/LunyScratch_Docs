I finished the HUD. The menu is there, but the current setup together with UnrealSharp's requirements didn't allow for easy hooking of UI events: ScratchUI would have to subclass from UUserWidget and then I'd have had to redesign the whole blueprints again, ugh.

So I left the buttons nonfunctional. Level reload crashes anyway, hard. I'm just tired of Unreal crashing, crashing, crashing and then some crashing.

Given that Unreal is the least likely to benefit from my Scratch experiment, I feel it's okay to leave it at 90% finished. The rest isn't unsolvable, just annoying extra work that for the most part would be easier with the core changes I have planned.

For reference, what is missing:

- correct UI event hooks from code
- reload current level (this crashes)
- quit application

Also I couldn't build and run. The build crashed because UnrealSharp didn't load. Probably also fixable but .. not now. I've had enough.

On the positive side I was able to create a postprocess material with the pixelation look. But I couldn't get the volumetric fog to give me just half a meter of dense ground fog.

So Unreal is this beast that just requires a lot of headbanging. Not the grinding metal kind.
