Yes — there *is* a talent shortage in the game industry in many regions and in many specializations. The shortage is uneven (both geographically and by role), but a lot of data points indicate that many studios *do* struggle to recruit people with the right skills. Below, I summarize what the evidence says, which specializations are most sought after, and what that means in practice.

---

## Evidence of Talent Shortage

Here are studies and reports that show the problem is real (not just anecdotal):

* In the UK, **68% of game developers** said they are experiencing skills shortages. ([Pocket Gamer][1])
* TIGA’s 2024 Skills Report showed that about **50% of games businesses** found it difficult or very difficult to fill vacancies. ([tiga.org][2])
* In China, reports show there are *more job openings than qualified candidates* in certain high technical specializations, especially in graphics/audio/video/image dev, algorithms, etc. ([China Daily][3])
* In India, rapidly growing game studios (especially those targeting higher-end / AAA-adjacent work) report a surge in demand for certain roles (gameplay engineers, 3D artists, animators, environment designers, backend/multiplayer). ([The Economic Times][4])
* In developing game regions (e.g. Vietnam), only about **30% of graduates** meet the job-requirements in industry according to local studios. ([gamota.com][5])

So, yes: skill shortages are widespread. The situation has improved somewhat in some places (according to TIGA), but there remains a significant mismatch between what studios need vs. what the available workforce can supply. ([tiga.org][2])

## Which Specializations / Skillsets Are Especially Sought After

Based on the data, these are among the most in-demand / hardest-to-fill specializations:

| Specialization                                                                             | Why It’s in Demand / Difficult to Fill                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gameplay / Engine Programmers** (especially in C++, graphics, performance, optimization) | Studios building more ambitious titles need engineers who deeply understand engine internals, rendering, optimization, memory constraints. These skills take years to gain. ([Team up group][6])                                                 |
| **3D Artists & Animators (environment, character, VFX)**                                   | High visual fidelity is expected, so there’s heavy demand for high-quality art. There are fewer people with both technical tools and aesthetic/animation skill. ([The Economic Times][4])                                                        |
| **Backend / Multiplayer Engineers**                                                        | As more games include live services, multiplayer, persistent world features, the need for scalable, secure, performant backend systems grows. Many studios report difficulty hiring for this. ([The Economic Times][4])                          |
| **Graphics / Rendering / Shader Specialists**                                              | Real-time graphics, ray tracing, advanced lighting, shaders, etc., are still technically challenging. Expertise in these is rare. ([China Daily][3])                                                                                             |
| **Technical Artists**                                                                      | Bridging art and engineering (e.g. shaders, pipelines, performance optimization). These roles are tricky because they require hybrid skills. ([Team up group][6])                                                                                |
| **Design / Level Design / UX / Narrative Design**                                          | Especially for studios trying to stand out, they need strong designers who can design experiences, controls, levels, and narrative. It's not just about technical skill; creative & human-facing talent is also hard to recruit. ([tiga.org][2]) |
| **Cross-platform / Mobile Optimization**                                                   | Studios targeting multiple platforms, or mobile in particular, need folks who know performance constraints, input differences, UI scaling, etc. ([xptalent.co.uk][7])                                                                            |
| **Emerging technologies: AI / VR / AR / procedural generation**                            | As games begin to leverage newer tech (AI, procedural content, VR/AR), there’s less established trained talent. Studios often report needing people with experience in these areas. ([China Daily][3])                                           |

---

## Magnitude & Variations

* The severity varies by country. Regions with fewer established game studios or fewer graduates trained in game dev tend to feel the shortage more acutely. E.g., India, Vietnam. ([ETHRWorld.com][8])
* Entry-level roles are somewhat easier to fill (or at least there's more supply), though there are still gaps (e.g. graduates with portfolios, relevant experience). Senior / specialized roles (graphics, engine, multiplayer) are hardest. ([tiga.org][2])
* Even when filling roles, there are often **skills gaps** (existing staff lack full proficiency in required areas). So it’s not just hiring; it’s also training / upskilling. ([tiga.org][2])

---

## What We Can Conclude with High Confidence

* There *is* a real shortage of talent in many game industry sectors, especially in technical roles and high-end art / graphics.
* Specializations that combine deep technical + creative skills are especially scarce (e.g. technical artists, shader specialists).
* Studios are increasingly struggling to recruit for backend, multiplayer, AI, and performance optimization roles as games become more complex and cross-platform.
* Regions with growing game industries but less established education/training pipelines suffer more from mismatch.

---

If you like, I can try to pull together some numbers (surveys, salary/hiring data) to estimate *how big the salary premium* is for the scarce roles, or *which roles are most difficult to fill (measured by time to hire)*. Would you prefer that?

Here’s what I found about the situation in German-speaking countries (mainly Germany) for 2024/2025, plus an assessment of how serious the shortage appears, and which specialisations are most affected. The evidence is somewhat less detailed than in some larger markets, but there *is* data.

---

## What the Evidence Says (Germany / Austria / Switzerland)

I didn’t find many reports that break things *exactly* for games dev vs. general tech, but there are several relevant signals:

| Source                                                                                                               | What it reports & relevance to games / tech / creative-tech industries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| game – The German Games Industry Association / Goldmedia / gamesmap.de (2025 Annual Report)                          | Reports that the number of companies and employees in Germany’s games industry declined slightly in 2025 after years of growth. ([game][1]) The decline is small (≈2% drop in employees, 4% drop in number of companies). Suggests strain, possibly from funding uncertainty or international competition. ([game][1])                                                            |
| Game funding / framework issues                                                                                      | The report finds that many smaller studios are finding the federal funding guidelines restrictive, and that conditions (budget caps, project timelines) make funding difficult to plan with. This causes instability. ([game][2])                                                                                                                                                 |
| “Two thirds of job listings with game-dev skills come from outside games industry” (German Economic Institute, 2024) | Many roles requiring game dev skills are being hired in other industries, which suggests both that game dev specialists are in demand beyond traditional game studios *and* that studios may have trouble competing with pay or stability. ([gamesmarket.global][3])                                                                                                              |
| Skilled labour / “Fachkräftemangel” overall in Germany                                                               | There are many reports (ifo, KfW, etc.) that Germany has a shortage of skilled workers in many sectors (IT, engineering, technical roles, etc.). For example, ~27-30% of firms report difficulty finding qualified staff. ([ifo Institut][4]) These are broad, not game-specific, but game dev draws from the same kinds of skills (programming, art, tech infrastructure, etc.). |
| STEM shortage reports                                                                                                | The STEM (science / tech / engineering / math) sector in Germany is reported to still have significant gaps: number of STEM specialists lacking, though the absolute shortage has eased somewhat. ([heise online][5])                                                                                                                                                             |

## Assessment: Is There a Game-Industry-Specific Shortage (2024-2025)?

Putting together what we *do* know:

* **Yes**, there is evidence for a *partial* shortage in Germany’s games sector, especially in certain sub-areas. But it’s less officially quantified than in e.g. UK or larger markets.
* The decline in employees/companies suggests that studios (especially smaller ones) are under pressure. Some of that pressure likely comes from difficulty hiring or retaining talent, especially when funding is unpredictable.
* The fact that many job listings seeking game dev skills are *outside* game studios suggests two things: game dev workers have transferable skills, and demand is strong enough broadly that perhaps studios lose talent to other industries.
* Funding instability, especially caps on budgets, shorter timelines, and unpredictable grant windows, increases risk and makes long/higher-investment roles harder to sustain. When you can’t reliably plan for lead time, hiring expensive or senior specialists becomes more risky.

## Which Specialisations Appear Especially Sought After in German Game-Dev (or Likely to Be)

While I didn’t find many Germany-only surveys that list exact percent shortages by role, combining general labour reports, media reports, and what German studios say in interviews, here are the specialisations that seem most in demand or under pressure:

| Specialisation                             | Reasons / Evidence that Demand or Shortage Exists in DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Programming / Gameplay Engineers**       | Because of international competition and rising costs, studios need engineers who can deliver solid, performant code. Studios often mention that development costs are 30% higher locally vs. international peers (because of funding, overhead). The risk is higher for small studios that need technical depth. ([game][6]) |
| **Art / Visuals / 3D Artists / Animation** | For games to compete globally, visual quality is important. But many smaller German studios may not have large art teams. Funding caps and budget uncertainty reduce how much they can invest in art / polish. Probably a squeeze here.                                                                                       |
| **Design / UX / Level Design**             | Translating game ideas into marketable, polished experiences is non-trivial; studios need designers who understand both creative and technical constraints. Anecdotally, German devs often mention design and polish as areas that get compromised in low-fund budget games.                                                  |
| **Technical Artists / Pipeline / Tools**   | Because Germany has strong technical engineering culture, studios want people who can help make pipelines efficient, reduce asset-import/export overheads, optimize build processes. Those roles are less glamorous but important.                                                                                            |
| **Project Management / Production**        | With funding uncertainty, delays, and small teams, effective production / scheduling / risk management becomes more valuable. German studios often cite unpredictability (regulation, funding) as a major challenge; having strong producers helps mitigate those.                                                            |
| **Other Tech / Backend / Multiplayer**     | Possibly less so than in AAA markets, but as more German studios try live-services or cross-platform / multiplayer features, the gap in backend/multiplayer engineering is increasing. Also, securing devops / cloud / server-side skills is harder.                                                                          |

---

## Limitations & Gaps in Data

* I didn’t find a Germany-only survey that lists *which specific game roles* are hardest to fill in 2024-2025 (programmer vs artist vs sound vs etc) with quantitative %s.
* Most data refers to “skills shortages” for all industries or for tech broadly, not just game dev. So there’s a possibility that games dev is less badly hit (or more) depending on location.
* Austria and Switzerland: very little publicly available data specific to their games industries (the German data dominates). It’s likely they see similar patterns (since many studios and schools cross borders), but confirmation is weaker.

---

## My Best Estimate for German-Speaking Countries

Putting together what I found, here’s a reasoned estimate of how severe the shortage is, plus which roles are in highest demand, if you focus just on Germany/Austria/Switzerland (DACH region):

* The majority of studios *do* face difficulty recruiting for certain roles, especially for **mid-senior programmers**, **3D artists / animators**, **technical artists**, and **producers / production staff**.
* Small studios are particularly vulnerable: they may delay hiring technical specialists or skip them entirely because risk/funding/growth is uncertain.
* Given funding instability in Germany (recent freezes / caps / stricter guidelines), the shortage for senior roles is worse: fewer applicants willing to take risk, fewer positions offering enough security or remuneration to attract high-skill individuals.
* I’d estimate that in 2024-2025, **~40-60%** of German game studios have at least one hard-to-fill role (senior engineer, senior artist, producer). The studios that report this likely under-report because of cost pressure or fear of showing weakness.
* For junior roles, there is less shortage, but quality / experience / readiness (portfolio, familiarity with modern toolchains) is often cited as weak among new grads.

---

## Conclusion

Yes — there *is* a talent shortage in the game industry in German-speaking countries, especially in specialised senior or hybrid roles (art + tools, backend, production). The evidence is less granular than in some other markets, but the trends are consistent: funding uncertainty, decline in number of employees, many roles being sought outside the games sector, and general skilled labor shortages in tech/STEM are all pointing in that direction.

If you like, I can try to find a German game-industry survey (in German) that gives breakdown by role (programming, art, etc.) for 2025, and quantify how many companies report “difficulty finding senior programmers” etc. Would that be useful?

I found some concrete German / DACH-region sources that report on recruitment difficulty / skills shortages in the game dev industry — especially the *game* association’s surveys. Here are those findings + what they imply (how many companies, which roles, how severe).

---

## Key Findings from Germany 2023–2025

1. **Member Survey of *game – Verband der deutschen Games-Branche***
   This is one of the most relevant sources. In a survey of 84 German game companies:

    * **~90%** of companies report that it is *difficult* to hire **game programmers**. ([igmonline.de][1])
    * **68%** report that hiring **Technical Artists** is difficult. ([igmonline.de][1])
    * **61%** report difficulties hiring in **Game Producing / Producers** roles. ([igmonline.de][1])
    * **59%** report difficulty in hiring **Game Designers**. ([igmonline.de][1])

   This survey was from January 2023 (so slightly older), but still fairly recent and regularly used as reference. ([igmonline.de][1])

2. **Annual Report 2025 (Germany)** by game / Goldmedia

    * The number of companies has fallen (−4%) in 2025 (to ~910 companies developing/publishing) after growth since 2020. ([game][2])
    * Employee numbers dropped slightly (≈2%) in that period. ([game][2])
    * Many companies report that *uncertain funding*, *funding application suspensions*, and *bureaucratic delays* make it hard to plan hiring. This makes recruiting specialists risky. ([game][2])

3. **“Two thirds of job listings with game-dev skills come from other industries”** (German Economic Institute, 2024)

    * Of nearly 5,000 German job listings that list “game dev skills,” **64%** are not from games studios, but from other sectors (automotive, consulting, architecture, IT). ([gamesmarket.global][3])
    * This suggests that not only are studios looking for talent, but much of the demand for people with game dev skills is outside games — implying competition.

4. **Fachkräftemangel and bureaucratic / regulatory barriers**

    * A repeated theme in reports is that hiring from “third-countries” (non-EU) is seen as a possible relief, but it’s hampered by bureaucracy, cost, recognition of qualifications. ([game][4])
    * Game companies also cite Germany’s “location disadvantages” for some high specialist roles (salary costs, regulation) as making recruitment harder. ([Der Spiegel][5])

## Estimates / Quantitative Indicators (Where Available)

From the game association’s survey and related:

| Role                        | % of companies reporting difficulty hiring that role |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Game / Software Programmers | ~90% ([igmonline.de][1])                             |
| Technical Artists           | ~68% ([igmonline.de][1])                             |
| Producers / Game Producing  | ~61% ([igmonline.de][1])                             |
| Game Designers              | ~59% ([igmonline.de][1])                             |

These are from ~84 companies surveyed. So the sample is modest but representative of Germany’s active game dev studios (especially small/mid-sized). ([igmonline.de][1])

---

## My Assessment & Implications

From those data points, we can reasonably conclude:

* The shortage is **real and acute** in Germany for certain high-skill / senior / specialist roles.
* In particular, *game/software programmers* are the top reported gap: ~90% of studios say they can’t find enough quality programmers. That’s a very strong signal.
* Following that, *technical artists*, *producers*, and *game designers* are also significantly hard to hire.
* The problem is compounded by funding unpredictability: when studios can’t plan, they tend to avoid hiring expensive senior specialists or full teams, preferring contract or smaller hires.
* The external demand from other sectors (automotive, architecture, IT) for similar skills means game dev studios are competing not just within games but with other industries. That raises salaries/burdens and makes retention harder.

## Gaps in the German Data

* The surveys mostly cover companies that are game studios / publishers; they may not capture **freelancers**, **very small hobby studios**, or those without formal company structures.
* The survey respondent sample (84 companies) is meaningful but not huge; heavy bias toward more established studios (likely those aware of / connected to game-association networks).
* Many roles are not broken down by seniority; i.e. we know “programmers” generally are hard to hire, but less often “junior vs mid-level vs senior.”
* Less data is publicly available for Austria / Switzerland separately — Germany dominates the datasets.

If you want, I can try to find unpublished or German language surveys from 2025 that show “time-to-fill” (how many months open positions remain open) broken down by role (programmer, artist, etc.) — that might give more resolution on how “hard” the shortage is in practice.
