Sequences now run with context on the MonoBehaviour, avoids passing in references. The lambda versions are disabled for now, these are secondary.

Added 'When' event handling with a CollisionStarted event that filters by name and/or tag. Since Godot uses "groups" this may be a bit confusing. Will need to come up with solution later. 

Playing sound via AudioSource and Destroy are implemented. However this needs improvement, as destroying an object that has the AudioSource cuts off the sound, or doesn't play it at all when using the new AudioRandomSource container. 

I was trying to avoid using additional context in collision or any other events, assuming that whatever happens on an object only affects that object. Thus both police and collectible cube both respond to each other's collision events. It's not efficient but avoids a lot of headaches. I probably still need some way of telling another object what to do. One way to accomplish this could be using DestroyOther(), since I already have DestroySelf() - with the "self" added mostly to avoid conflict with Object.Destroy() in Unity.

In any case, I would have found need for both the Asset and Scene Object registries. To do PlaySound("by name") and to do Destroy("that object"). But not for the MVP.

I switched to Junie today. Quite different experience compared to Claude. For one, Junie is very slow. But she updates all the code in place and so far she has done it without issues. In fact, she can build the project and respond to compile errors. Great for issuing a task and taking a short break. Not so great when you need a quick fix or answer. Fortunately, she picks up all my changes instantly, so I can just go in and correct what I don't like and issue the next task. Claude used to assume the code didn't change, causing errors and rework.

I have only 9 AI credits left of 35 after subscribing to AI Ultimate (€300 pa). That means I'm looking at buying another 10-20 extra credits this month (12-24€). 

I will try to avoid too many extra consultations. I also use the daily quota for ChatGPT for general questions, like the "talent shortage in game industry" inquiry.  

Yesterday's inquiry about game production budgets and counts per budget totally confirms my notion that at least half (if not three quarters) of all games published (desktop, web, mobile) are small or tiny projects with likely budgets below $50k.
