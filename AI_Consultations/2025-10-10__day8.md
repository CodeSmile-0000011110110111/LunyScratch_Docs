Today I added a score label with data binding (UI Toolkit). Also spawning prefabs on collision just for FX, which meant creating an Asset Registry. And I put the car on training wheels (extra colliders) so it won't topple so quickly.

Junie makes doing these quick adds real nice but it still requires review, and refactoring afterwards. It really helps to be detailed about the specifications but then there's the risk of setting her mind on a solution that takes me too literally.

Nevertheless, for an MVP it's a real time-saver. Being careful, I spent "only" 1.9 credits today but that's still above my daily target of 1.4.

Still, this has really changed how I regard code now. For the past couple years I was becoming more and more disinterested in writing the menial chore code. Now I'm more focused on architecture and API, and at least for this MVP I'm much more okay with just code that works even though it's not quite to my liking.

Junie has one downside: she doesn't converse. Unlike GPT5 which is all too eager to please me, I still kind of miss these "consultations". I am using its free plan for such inquiries.

What's next?

Definitely "restart" ie reload the current scene is a necessity to complete the lifecycle and catch any restart issues. 

Maybe I'll need a win condition, which means adding a way to pause or cancel sequences (input). And perhaps a timer so you got only 30 seconds or so per run.
