Not an AI consultation. Just a quick summary.

I ended up spending the entire day trying to restructure the project so that it best supports sharing code with and working in three different engines.

It's working now with nested submodules:

```
Example
Example/../Engine-Code              -- submodule
Example/../Engine-Code/../Core      -- nested submodule
```

I spent the second half of the day chasing git kinks. The larger part was trying to set up git worktrees for instant code sharing locally. However, this was a complete disaster.

The detached head in submodules was annoying but fixable once I learned I have to commit from inside out, and installed a git hook to ensure this never happens again.
